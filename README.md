Getting started with node, the package

The Node.js community is filled with awesome people. The hope for the package is that it will provide a path for those new to the scene to get a jumpstart and make a few friends along the way.

### The intention:
- getting started resources for Node.js
- [nodejs.org](nodejs.org) API docs
- [npmjs.org](npmjs.org)
- a primer or two on JS
- irc channel setup, potentially an ircbot to help connect the user to the Node.js community for realtime problem-solving
- mentors section of knode.io connected
- "find your local meetup"
